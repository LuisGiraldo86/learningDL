# Introduction to Deep Learning

This repository contains multiple Python notebooks developed to make the first steps into Deep Learning. They are inspired by Fran√ßois Chollet's book _Deep Learning with Python_.

The notebooks do not cover the entire book, only the first examples from Chapter 4 and some others from Chapter 7.
